# login_app_nodejs

With this code we can make an app where we send a request to a server and receive its response, we control what we want to show according to the user's request.

We use node.js, express and ejs templates as a tool to display our project.

We must remember to make the dependencies by installing nodemon, express and ejs and modify our package.json, here the package.json of the project is shown.

Inside our index.js file we set the requests with JavaScript, this is just a model.
